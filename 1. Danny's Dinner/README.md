# Introduction

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

# Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers. Having a deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

# Data

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
* **SALES:** captures all [customer_id]() level purchases with an corresponding [order_date]() and [product_id]() information for when and what menu items were ordered.
* **MENU:** maps the [product_id]() to the actual [product_name]() and price of each menu item.
* **MEMBERS:** captures the [join_date]() when a [customer_id]() joined the beta version of the Dannyâ€™s Diner loyalty program.

# Case Study Solutions

1. **What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
* Left join the data from the menu table to the sales table using the product_id as the link between the two tables.
* Group the orders made in the sales table by the customer_id.
* Sum the price for each order by customer_id to obtain the total_spent by customer.
```SQL
SELECT s.customer_id, 
	SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```
---
| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

2. **How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
* Group the orders made in the sales table by the customer_id.
* Use the distinct count function on order_date to count the number of unique dates per customer.

```SQL
SELECT customer_id, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT order_date)
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
---

| customer_id | count |
| ----------- | ----- |
| A           | 4     |
| B           | 6     |
| C           | 2     |

3. **What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
* Left join the data from the menu table to the sales table using the product_id as the link between the two tables.
* Sort the table by the order_date and then by customer_id to find the earliest purchases by customer.
* Note one, customers A and C ordered more than one item during their first purchase.
* Note two, the query below will return all the orders made sorted by date and customer. The table below is a subset of the full table.
```SQL
SELECT s.customer_id, 
       s.order_date, 
       m.product_name
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
ORDER BY s.order_date, 
	 s.customer_id;
```
---
| customer_id | order_date               | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |
| A           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | curry        |
| C           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | ramen        |
| C           | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | ramen        |

4. **What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
* Left join the data from the menu table to the sales table using the product_id as the link between the two tables.
* Count the number of times each product_id appears in the sales table 
* Sort the joined table by the purchase_count of each product_id from greatest to least
* Limit the output to the top product_name purchased
```SQL
SELECT s.product_id, 
       m.product_name, 
       COUNT(s.product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.product_id, m.product_name
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
---
| product_id | product_name | purchase_count |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 3          | ramen        | 8              |
---


5. **Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
7. **Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
8. **Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
9. **What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
10. **If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
11. **In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
