# Introduction

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

# Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers. Having a deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

# Data

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
* **SALES:** captures all [customer_id]() level purchases with an corresponding [order_date]() and [product_id]() information for when and what menu items were ordered.
* **MENU:** maps the [product_id]() to the actual [product_name]() and price of each menu item.
* **MEMBERS:** captures the [join_date]() when a [customer_id]() joined the beta version of the Dannyâ€™s Diner loyalty program.

# Case Study Solutions

1. **What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```SQL
SELECT s.customer_id, 
	SUM(m.price) AS total_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```

**Schema (PostgreSQL v13)**
---

| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |
