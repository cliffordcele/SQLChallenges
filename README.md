# 8 Week SQL Challenge - Case Studies
 

[Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/) has created the [Serious SQL](https://www.datawithdanny.com/courses/serious-sql) course that covers many core SQL skills and techniques required for data analysis. As part of the course, they offer eight free [case studies](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/) with data for students to learn SQL through multiple realistic end-to-end case studies that closely represent the sort of work performed in a data analytics role. Each folder in this repository contains my solution to each case study listed below.
