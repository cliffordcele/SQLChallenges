# Introduction

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

# Problem Statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers. Having a deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.

# Data & Entity Relationship Diagram

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
* sales
* menu

2.	How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3.	What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4.	What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5.	Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6.	Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7.	Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8.	What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9.	If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10.	In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
