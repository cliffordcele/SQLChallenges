# Introduction
Pizza Runner is a uber-style pizza delivery company. “Runners” deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters 
(otherwise known as Danny’s house). Danny has also paid freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

# Problem
Danny would like to clean the data he has collected, and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and 
optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.
